# Software Engineering

Software engineering is the practical use of scientific methods 
for the economic development of software its use and maintenance.

## Goals SWE 

- Quality software
- Reduction of errors
- Reduction of work
- Maximize clients

## Life cycle of software

1. Analysis of requirements
2. Design and Architecture
3. Implementation 
4. Testing
5. Introduction in the system
6. Maintenance

## Waterfall Model

This model takes the steps of the life cycle and orders them 
into descending order as the way software is planed, developed, used and 
maintained. It has been criticized for not being realistic.

## V-Model
The V-Model is an extension of the waterfall model. It emphasizes the
importance of testing at each stage of development. The left side of the V
represents the stages of development, while the right side represents the
stages of testing. The bottom of the V represents the implementation stage.

| Left Side of V       | Middle of V    | Right Side of V     |
|:---------------------|:--------------:|---------------------|
| Requirements Analysis|      <-        | Acceptance Testing  |
| System Design        |      <-        | System Testing      |
| Architecture Design  |      <-        | Integration Testing |
| Specification Design |      <-        | Unit Testing        |
|                      | Implementation |                     |

## Iterative Development

This model allows developers to plan multiple iterations of the steps: Analysis, Proposal, Implementation and Testing.
Each iteration is a mini-waterfall model. This allows for more flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements
and feedback from users. It is often used in Agile methodologies.

The problems with the waterfall model are that it is too rigid and does not allow for changes once the development process has started.

## Incremental Development

In this model, the software is developed in small increments or modules. Each increment adds new functionality to the software.
This allows for faster delivery of software and the ability to get feedback from users early in the development process.
It is often used in Agile methodologies as well.

The disadvantage of this model is that it can lead to integration issues if the increments are not well planned and designed. Also,
sometimes the first proposals are not well-thought-out and lead to problems later on in the development process.
