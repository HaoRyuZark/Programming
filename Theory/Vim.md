Here's a Markdown file that documents **[lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)** — a fast, modern plugin manager for **Neovim**. It includes sections on what Lazy is, how to install and use it, the structure of the config, and common commands.

# lazy.nvim — Modern Plugin Manager for Neovim

[lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) is a **modern, fast, and feature-rich** plugin manager for Neovim (>= 0.8). It supports lazy-loading, event-driven plugin loading, performance profiling, and more.

---

## 📦 Installation

You can install `lazy.nvim` by cloning it into the `~/.config/nvim/lazy` directory or using the following command:

```lua
-- ~/.config/nvim/init.lua or ~/.config/nvim/lua/init.lua

-- Bootstrap lazy.nvim
local lazypath = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/lazy/lazy.nvim"
if not vim.loop.fs_stat(lazypath) then
  vim.fn.system({
    "git", "clone", "--filter=blob:none",
    "https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim.git",
    "--branch=stable", -- latest stable release
    lazypath,
  })
end
vim.opt.rtp:prepend(lazypath)

-- Load your plugins
require("lazy").setup("plugins") -- 'plugins' is the module with your plugin list
````

---

## 📁 Plugin Configuration Structure

The plugin list is usually stored in `lua/plugins/` as separate Lua files or a single file.

Example structure:

```
~/.config/nvim/
├── init.lua
└── lua/
    ├── plugins/
    │   ├── init.lua     <-- calls `lazy.setup()`
    │   ├── lsp.lua
    │   ├── treesitter.lua
    │   └── telescope.lua
```

Each file in `lua/plugins/` returns a plugin spec or a list of specs:

```lua
-- lua/plugins/telescope.lua
return {
  {
    "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
    dependencies = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" },
    cmd = "Telescope",
    keys = {
      { "<leader>ff", "<cmd>Telescope find_files<cr>", desc = "Find Files" },
    },
    config = function()
      require("telescope").setup()
    end,
  },
}
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Adding Plugins

Add plugin specs to a file inside `lua/plugins/`:

```lua
-- lua/plugins/lualine.lua
return {
  {
    "nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim",
    config = function()
      require("lualine").setup()
    end,
    event = "VimEnter", -- lazy-load on startup event
  }
}
```

### Lazy Loading Options

You can use many triggers to lazy-load plugins:

* `event` — e.g., `"BufRead"`, `"InsertEnter"`
* `cmd` — plugin loads on command
* `keys` — loads on keypress
* `ft` — loads on filetype
* `dependencies` — plugin dependencies

---

## 💡 Common Commands

Once `lazy.nvim` is set up, use the following commands in Neovim:

| Command         | Description                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `:Lazy`         | Open Lazy's UI dashboard      |
| `:Lazy install` | Install plugins               |
| `:Lazy update`  | Update plugins                |
| `:Lazy sync`    | Install + clean + update      |
| `:Lazy clean`   | Remove unused plugins         |
| `:Lazy restore` | Restore plugins from lockfile |
| `:Lazy profile` | Show startup time profiling   |
| `:Lazy log`     | Show plugin load logs         |

---

## 🔧 Tips

* Use `config = function()` to configure plugins.
* Use `opts = {}` to pass options directly to plugins that support `opts`.
* For large setups, split plugins across multiple files under `lua/plugins/`.
* Run `:Lazy profile` to optimize your config.

## 🧾 Example Plugin Spec

```lua
-- lua/plugins/example.lua
return {
  {
    "lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim",
    event = "BufReadPre",
    opts = {
      signs = {
        add = { text = "+" },
        change = { text = "~" },
        delete = { text = "_" },
      },
    },
  },
